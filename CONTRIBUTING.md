This document describes a process of contribution to NetSel project.

## Vocabulary

* A **Committer** is a subset of contributors who have been given write access to the repository.

# Logging Issues

Log an issue for any question or problem you might have. When in doubt, log an issue,
any additional policies about what to include will be provided in the responses.

# Contributions

Any change to resources in this repository must be through pull requests. This applies to all changes
to documentation, code, etc. Even long term committers must usepull requests.

Pull requests should be independent so they can be merged/rejected independently of other
pull requests. Every pull request must be made on a separate branch, branched off from the HEAD
of the master branch. No pull requests should depend on other pull requests or be branched off
from non-master branches. 

No pull request can be merged without being reviewed.

Pull requests should sit for at least 48 hours to ensure that contributors have time to review.

The default for each contribution is that it is accepted once no committer has an objection.

In the case of an objection being raised in a pull request by another committer, all involved
committers should seek to arrive at a consensus by way of addressing concerns being expressed
by discussion, compromise on the proposed change, or withdrawal of the proposed change.

# Becoming a Committer
